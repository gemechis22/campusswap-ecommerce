# Phase 1: HTML/CSS Foundation

In this phase, you'll learn to create the **visual foundation** of CampusSwap using pure HTML and CSS.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

### HTML Concepts You'll Master:
- **Semantic HTML5** - Using the right elements for content structure
- **Document Structure** - Head, body, and proper nesting
- **Navigation** - Creating accessible menu systems
- **Content Sections** - Headers, main content, sidebars, footers
- **Forms** - Search bars, login forms, product upload forms

### CSS Concepts You'll Master:
- **Modern Layout** - CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design
- **Typography** - Creating visual hierarchy with fonts
- **Color Systems** - Building a consistent color palette
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach
- **Component Thinking** - Styling reusable UI components

## 🏗️ What We're Building

**Target**: A static (non-interactive) version of CampusSwap that looks professional and modern.

### Pages We'll Create:
1. **Homepage** (`index.html`) - Landing page with featured listings
2. **Browse** (`browse.html`) - Product catalog with categories
3. **Product Detail** (`product.html`) - Individual product page
4. **Login** (`login.html`) - Authentication forms

### Key Components:
- **Navigation Bar** - Logo, menu, search, user actions
- **Hero Section** - Welcome message and call-to-action
- **Product Grid** - Responsive listing cards
- **Product Card** - Image, title, price, seller info
- **Footer** - Links, contact info, university branding

## 💡 Why Start with Static HTML/CSS?

1. **Foundation First** - Understanding structure before interactivity
2. **Visual Design** - Get the look and feel right early
3. **Responsive Layout** - Ensure it works on all devices
4. **Component Identification** - See what will become React components later
5. **Professional Practice** - Real developers often start with mockups
